# Notebooks on MaxwellBloch

A set of Jupyter Notebooks on the [MaxwellBloch](https://github.com/tommyogden/maxwellbloch/) package.

> MaxwellBloch is a Python package for solving the coupled Maxwell-Bloch
> equations describing the nonlinear propagation of near-resonant light through
> thermal atomic vapours.
